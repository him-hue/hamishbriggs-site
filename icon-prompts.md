# World Tree Product Icons: Generation Prompts

## Shared Style Brief

All six icons should feel like they belong to the same family. Hand these constraints to whichever generation tool you use, then follow with the individual product prompts below.

**Format:** Square, transparent background (or solid black #0a0a0a background matching the site). Export as SVG or high-res PNG at 512x512 minimum.

**Colour palette:** Monochrome. Thin white or off-white (#e8e4df) linework on black/transparent. No fills, no gradients, no colour accents. The website is dark with cream-white text, so the icons should feel like they were drawn with a single fine pen on a dark canvas.

**Line weight:** Uniform, thin (think 1-2px at display size). Clean vector-style strokes, not sketchy or hand-drawn.

**Complexity:** Simple enough to read at 32x32 pixels. No more than ~15-20 line segments per icon. These sit alongside Cormorant Garamond headings and Inter body text on a cinematic dark background. They should feel quiet, not busy.

**Motif:** Each icon is a variation on a node-and-connection network (neural net / constellation style), but each one has a distinctive element that signals the product's domain. The network motif binds them visually; the domain element differentiates them.

**What to avoid:** Rounded bubbly shapes, thick strokes, colour fills, photorealism, 3D effects, drop shadows, glow, neon. Nothing that looks like a SaaS marketing icon pack. These should feel more like architectural diagrams or constellation maps.

## Individual Prompts

### 1. StoryMap

**Concept:** A neural network with a literary twist.

**Prompt:** "Minimalist line icon on black background. A small constellation of 5-7 connected nodes arranged in a branching narrative arc (like a story spine curving upward left to right). One node is slightly larger, representing a central narrative thread. Woven through or beside the network is a single delicate quill or pen nib shape, abstracted to just a few strokes. Thin white lines only. No fill. Constellation/blueprint aesthetic."

**Key visual elements:** Branching arc of connected nodes + abstracted quill/pen nib


### 2. Index

**Concept:** A DNA-like neural network, more infrastructural and foundational than the others.

**Prompt:** "Minimalist line icon on black background. A vertical double-helix structure made of connected nodes, like DNA crossed with a circuit diagram. The two strands are linked by horizontal rungs (3-4 rungs). Nodes sit at each intersection point. The overall shape should feel like infrastructure, a backbone or spine that other things attach to. Thin white lines only. No fill. Constellation/blueprint aesthetic."

**Key visual elements:** Double-helix node structure with connecting rungs, vertical orientation


### 3. ProductionMap

**Concept:** A neural network with a cinema twist.

**Prompt:** "Minimalist line icon on black background. A network of 5-7 connected nodes arranged in a grid-like pattern suggesting a production timeline or storyboard layout (rows and columns, loosely). Integrated into or adjacent to the network is a single abstracted film frame or clapperboard shape, reduced to just its essential geometry (a rectangle with a hinged top edge). Thin white lines only. No fill. Constellation/blueprint aesthetic."

**Key visual elements:** Grid-like node network + abstracted clapperboard/film frame


### 4. MarketingMap

**Concept:** A neural network with a marketing/audience twist.

**Prompt:** "Minimalist line icon on black background. A network of 5-7 connected nodes with one central node radiating outward to several peripheral nodes, like a broadcast or signal pattern (centre-out topology, not a chain). The peripheral nodes are slightly smaller, suggesting an audience. One or two thin concentric arcs emanate from the central node, like a signal or broadcast wave (just partial arcs, not full circles). Thin white lines only. No fill. Constellation/blueprint aesthetic."

**Key visual elements:** Centre-out radial node network + broadcast signal arcs


### 5. DomainDataMine

**Concept:** A global neural network.

**Prompt:** "Minimalist line icon on black background. A network of 7-9 connected nodes distributed across a subtle spherical or globe-like wireframe (just a circle with one or two latitude/longitude curve lines to suggest a globe, not a detailed earth). The nodes sit on the globe's surface and are connected by thin lines that follow the curvature. The overall impression is a worldwide network of knowledge. Thin white lines only. No fill. Constellation/blueprint aesthetic."

**Key visual elements:** Globe wireframe with distributed connected nodes


### 6. Yggdrasil (World Tree)

**Concept:** A stylised World Tree that symbolically binds all the others. Simpler than you'd think.

**Prompt:** "Minimalist line icon on black background. A single stylised tree: one vertical trunk line with 3-4 branches extending upward and outward, and 2-3 root lines extending downward. At the end of each branch and root, a small node (dot). Thin connecting lines between some of the branch-nodes suggest a network woven into the canopy. The overall silhouette should read as 'tree' instantly but feel like a circuit diagram or constellation. This is the parent icon of the set. Thin white lines only. No fill. Constellation/blueprint aesthetic."

**Key visual elements:** Trunk + branches + roots with nodes at endpoints, network lines in the canopy

## Usage Notes

- When placing these on the website, they'll appear at roughly 48-64px display size alongside product names
- They should work as favicon-style marks at small sizes
- If the generation tool produces something too complex, ask it to simplify by reducing the node count
- Consistency matters more than individual cleverness. If one icon looks noticeably different in weight or complexity, regenerate it
